# Electron Projects

## Build over 9 cross-platform desktop applications from scratch

### Installation

### Install on Windows System

#### Install Node.js on Windows

1. Navigate to https://nodejs.org/en and get the corresponding installer. Note that the website detects your platform for you and suggests the corresponding installer package. For Windows, you are going to see the Download for Windows (x64) label and two buttons where you can select either the LTS, that is, the stable LTS version, or a current one, with the most recent cutting-edge features.

2. Download and run the installation file. Proceed with the setup wizard and use the default settingsâ€”these are usually pretty reasonable.



### Install on Linux System

#### Install Node.js on Linux

Ubuntu usually doesn't ship with the Node.js and NPM tools out of the box. You need to install them
separately.

To install Node.js, follow these steps:

1. Run the following command:

sudo apt install -y nodejs

2.- Now, we need to verify that Node.js has been installed. You can check the version that you've installed in the Terminal application by using the following command:

node --version

The system's output, which will be the version's value, will be for instance v8.11.4 or higher.

To install NPM, follow these steps:

1. Use the following command:

sudo apt install -y npm

2. The fastest way to check that NPM has been installed is to check its version. You can do so by using the following command:

npm --version

The version number should be 5.8.0 or higher.
